## Sessional Helper Application Angular  App

Nowadays receiving information via text message or whatsapp is very confusing for the teachers as well the students, so making an app called sessional exam helper will create a lot of ease for the students and teachers. Generally, we miss those important messages in the mid of other messages and we donâ€™t find it when required. This app will help a lot and will display all data in a sorted way and it is also very much easier for the Teachers to provide the information such as syllabus and exam dates in their respective subjects.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
